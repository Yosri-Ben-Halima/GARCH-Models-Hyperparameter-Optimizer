# GARCH-Models-Hyperparameter-Optimizer
An optimization tool for GARCH model parameters using Optuna. This project automates the hyperparameter tuning process to enhance model performance by selecting optimal values for parameters. It supports various volatility models and error distributions, with a focus on minimizing a composite score.
